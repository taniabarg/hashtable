Dynamic Hash Table in C

Designed a dynamic hash table in C for CSC190, given certain objectives such as function prototypes. 

- used separate chaining with binary trees
- allowed the hash table to expand and contract based on the load factor
- program was “Valgrind clean”, i.e. clear of any memory leaks
